# Ansible Role for SSHD Hardening
**Author/Maintainer:** Josh Murphy

## Overview

This Ansible role hardens the SSHD Config by doing the below:
```yaml
- Creates SSH Users
- Adds to Sudo/Wheel if desired.
- Sets SSH Allowed Users
- Copys SSH PubKeys
- Sets Allow/Deny Root SSH Login
- Sets Allow/Deny Empty Passwords
- Sets Allow/Deny Password Authentication
- Sets Allow/Deny Pubkey Authentication
- Sets Allow/Deny X11Forwarding
- Sets an Inactivity Timeout on SSH Sessions
- Sets Allow/Deny HostBasedAuthentication
- Sets Allow/Deny IgnoreRhosts
- Sets SSH LogLevel
- Sets MaxAuthTries
- Sets MaxSessions
- Sets MaxStartups
- Sets PrintMotd
- Restarts when any of the above has changed to apply settings.
Backups of the SSHD config are taken when any changes happen so you can revert easily if needed.
